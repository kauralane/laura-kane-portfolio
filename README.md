# Portfolio - Laura Kane

## Description
This application is the first iteration of my front-end web development page. I created this using HTML and CSS, primarily using grids and the flexbox.

I learnt from doing this project that it's definitely best to do media queries, styling for smaller screens, as you go! I left all my media queries to the end and then struggled with getting all my elements to resize nicely. 

This page showcases my CV, how to contact me, and gives a flavour of some of the projects I've done so far.

## Installation
None

## Usage
This is a simple web page which can be viewed on multiple screen sizes. It has some navigation links which will take you to the relevant place on the page, and a few links which will open new tabs.
